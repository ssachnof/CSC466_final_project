Question 1 & 2 - Sam question: I have not decided which approach I am planning on using: 
 A): predict who wins game given 1st half of data
 B): predict who wins game given whole game's data

Question 3 - Ryan question: Deciding between:
 Classifier to predict who will win playoff games based on how well teams did in the season
 
Question 4 - Grayson Question:
 Can we use K-Means clustering based on a teamâ€™s offensive, defensive, and special teams performance for a season to determine the relationship between these components and rankings? 
  -> Can we predict what play styles are most effective from this relationship?
 
Question 5 - Conor question:
 Classifier to predict what position a player plays based on their stats
